### Test Coverage with Jacoco
This project is configured with Jacoco, a code coverage library which ensures that your code is adequately covered by tests.

* Running Tests with Jacoco
* Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.

Execute the following command:


```
./gradlew clean
./gradlew test
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```
This will run the tests and generate a coverage report.

# Viewing the Jacoco Report
Once the tests have completed, the Jacoco report can be found in:


```
/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
```
Open this file in any web browser to view the coverage details.

### Cucumber Testing
To execute the application tests and generate the Cucumber report:

```
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build

```
Upon completion, the test report can be accessed at:
```
reports/cucumber/report
```
Open html file in a browser to see detailed test outcomes.
